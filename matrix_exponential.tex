\section{The Matrix Exponential}
\subsection{The Exponential Map and Matrix Groups}
Given an $n \times n$ matrix $A$, we want to find a way to find $e^A$. We can actually
just do this with the usual power series:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
    e^A = I_n + \sum_{p \ge 1} \frac{A^p}{p!} = \sum_{p \ge 0} \frac{A^p}{p!}
\end{equation}
Using an inductive proof, we can show that this is well defined. But we won't write
it out here.
