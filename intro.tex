\section*{Introduction}
First and foremost I want to clarify that by no means am I an expert on the presented
topics or any topics in mathematics for that matter. I have wanted to study complex
geometry for quite some time but was unable take a course or do research in the area.
So this is me exploring complex geometry and some of the topics that are parallel.
As it happens, this requires a full course on differential geometry and Lie groups.
I'm taking these notes from 3-4 books as well as supplemental notes found online.
Of course these will all be cited at the end. The end goal is to prepare myself for
spectral/noncommutative geometry. However, the functional analysis side of things
would be a novel on it's own. Some functional analysis will pop up here and there
in these notes but only in the context of geometry. I am not going to go too deep
into operator algebras or anything like that. Most of this information is new to
me at the time of writing. Also worth noting, I am writing this with a VERY casual
approach so my language and verbiage may not be as formal or precise, I'm writing
what my brain is thinking. Lots of proofs will be ommitted but more the simpler ones
I will probably include. Some of the proofs just require results that are beyond
the scope of the current section, but I will of course cite the books that contain
the proofs. I am documenting my journey of learning geometry and whatever may branch
off of it that interests me.
