\section*{Introduction}
First and foremost I want to clarify that by no means am I an expert on the presented
topics or any topics in mathematics for that matter. I have wanted to study complex
geometry for quite some time but was unable take a course or do research in the area.
So this is me exploring complex geometry and some of the topics that are parallel.
Most of this information is new to me at the time of writing. Also worth noting,
I am writing this with a VERY casual approach so my language and verbiage may not be
as formal or precise, I'm writing what my brain is thinking. I am documenting my
journey of learning complex geometry and whatever may branch off of it that interests
me.
